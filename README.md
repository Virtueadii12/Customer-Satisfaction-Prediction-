# Customer Satisfaction Prediction  

## üìå Project Description  
Customer satisfaction is a critical factor for the success and growth of any business. In today‚Äôs competitive market, retaining customers is as important as acquiring new ones. This project aims to **predict customer satisfaction levels** using machine learning techniques, based on historical data such as service quality, complaint resolution time, product usability, and engagement metrics.  

By identifying dissatisfied customers in advance, businesses can take **proactive measures** to improve their services, reduce churn, and enhance overall customer loyalty.
